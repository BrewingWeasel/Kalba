# Kalba

Kalba a language learning tool based on the idea of [sentence mining](https://refold.la/roadmap/stage-2/a/basic-sentence-mining).
It allows you to seamlessly integrate consuming media, getting definitions, and adding flashcards.
Kalba is designed to be extensible so that users can configure it for any language.
However, it also comes with out of the box support for several languages, with more planned.
