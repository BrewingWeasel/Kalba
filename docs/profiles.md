# Profiles

In general, users will have one profile per language they use Kalba for.
Each profile independently keeps track of Word Knowledge, dictionaries, grammar and other language specific settings.

## Templates

When creating a new profile, users will be presented with profile templates.
These templates generally correspond to a specific language and include useful defaults such as dictionaries, frequency lists and spyglys grammars.
If none of the templates match your language, you can always use the "custom" template, which provides a clean slate for your new profile.

## Changing profiles

The quick settings section at the top right of every page provides an option for switching profiles. (TODO: also add a command)
