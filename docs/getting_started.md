# Getting Started

When you first launch the app, you will be greeted with the following screen:
![getting_started](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0331ee30-910c-4210-ba95-aa8915d472ee)

Your first step is to choose a starter template for your first [profile](profiles.md)
![starter_template](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4295938c-3ecb-429a-a659-cd4bad3ae8a6)

If your target language doesn't have an existing template, you can simply click custom and set it up later in "Setting up a new language".
You can also make an issue and I will try to add that language at some later point.

From there, if you are planning on using Anki, you can set up your Word Knowledge deck sources by clicking on the plus.
If you see "Anki is not available", you may need to open Anki or make sure that AnkiConnect is actually installed. 
You can hit the refresh button to make sure it is set up.
See [Word Knowledge](word_knowledge.md) and [Word Knowledge Settings](word_knowledge_settings.md#Anki) for information on how to properly configure this.

Installing and setting up stanza is generally recommended. See [Stanza](stanza.md) for details on when you would want to set it up.

Congrats! You just did the main set up for Kalba. 
If you are using the "custom" template to set up a new language, check out [Setting up a new language](new_language.md).
Otherwise, you can jump directly to [Next Steps](next_steps.md).
