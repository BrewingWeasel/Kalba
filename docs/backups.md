# Backups

Kalba currently does not have a system for automated backups.
However, you can manually backup your data by copying the `saved_data.toml` file in your data directory (~/.local/share/kalba on Linux, ~/Library/Application Support/kalba on macOS, and %APPDATA%/kalba on Windows).
Your configuration file can be found at (~/.config/kalba.toml on Linux, ~/Library/Application Support/kalba.toml on macOS, and %APPDATA%/kalba.toml on Windows).
