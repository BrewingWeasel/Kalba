# Requirements

If you are planning on using [Stanza], you will need to have a relatively recent version of python (3.8+).
If you need help, you can follow this [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTawAg3VgCI).

If you are planning on linking your Anki deck, you will need to have [AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) installed.

You can always set either of these up after the installation and setup.
