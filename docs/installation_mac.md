# Installation (MacOS)

Note: if you are planning on using stanza, make sure you have a suitable version of python installed (3.8+).
You can always set this up after the initial installation.

To get started, download the aarch64.dmg (for modern M Serires Macs) or the x64.dmg (for older macs) from the [releases pages](https://github.com/BrewingWeasel/Kalba/releases).
Then, right (or ctrl) click on the file in your Downloads folder and click open, and then open again.
From there you can simply drag the file into your Applications folder inside the installer.
Finally, go to the Applications directory and right/ctrl click on the Kalba.app file and click open, and then open once again.
