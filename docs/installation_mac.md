# Installation (MacOS)

Note: you will get some warnings about the app being from an unidentified developer as I haven't paid Apple a bunch of money to verify it.
These can be safely ignored.
Or, because Kalba is open source, you can also manually check the code to see if it is safe.

To get started, download the aarch64.dmg (for modern M Serires Macs) or the x64.dmg (for older macs) from the [releases pages](https://github.com/BrewingWeasel/Kalba/releases).
Then, right (or ctrl) click on the file in your Downloads folder and click open, and then open again.
From there you can simply drag the file into your Applications folder inside the installer.
Finally, go to the Applications directory and right/ctrl click on the Kalba.app file and click open, and then open once again.
