# Installation (Windows)

Note: if you are planning on using stanza, make sure you have a suitable version of python installed (3.8+).
You can always set this up after the initial installation.

Download the .msi from the [releases page](https://github.com/BrewingWeasel/Kalba/releases), and double click on it.
It may pop up with a warning about windows defender protecting you from an unknown application.

To get pass this, click "more info" and then run anyway.
If this makes you feel uncomfortable you can run it through an antivirus or manually [look through the source code](https://github.com/BrewingWeasel/Kalba/).

From there, you can follow the instructions in the installer. The defaults should be fine for most people.
