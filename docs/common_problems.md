# Common Problems

## Unable to connect to Anki

If you have AnkiConnect installed and are unable to connect to Anki (even after restarting Anki and Kalba), AnkiConnect may be configured to use a different port.
To fix this, go to Tools -> Add-ons -> AnkiConnect -> Config in Anki and check the number after "webBindPort."
You can then update Kalba to connect to this same port in Settings -> Anki -> AnkiConnect Port.

## Missing minimize and maximize buttons (GNOME)

The Minimize and Maximize buttons may be missing from the window title bar in GNOME.
To fix this, make sure you have GNOME Tweaks installed, and then enable the Minimize and Maximize buttons under Gnome Tweaks -> Windows -> Titlebar Buttons.
