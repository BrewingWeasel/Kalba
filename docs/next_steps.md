# Next Steps

Now that you have your profile set up, you will likely want to change a few details about the [word knowledge](word_knowledge.md).

First, in the [word knowledge settings](word_knowledge_settings.md), you will likely want to set the number of words known by frequency.
In general, it is better to estimate on the low end with this, as it's trivial to mark words as known later.
Note: if you are using a custom profile or a less complete template, you may not have a frequency list and as such may not be able to set the words known by frequency.

Next, you'll want to click "force refresh anki knowledge" to make sure that the word knowledge from anki and the frequency list is saved.
This will likely take a few minutes, especially if you have a lot of cards in your anki deck.

Finally, you may want to update some of the other defaults of the template (particularly the dictionaries).

From there, you can start using the reader!
