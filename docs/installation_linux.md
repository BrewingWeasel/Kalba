# Installation (Linux)

A flatpak of Kalba will eventually be provided, and that will be the recommended way of installing Kalba.
In the mean time, you can use one of the alternate installation methods for Linux.

If you are planning on using [Stanza](stanza.md), you will need python 3.8 or later installed.
This will likely already be installed, but you can check by running `python --version` or `python3 --version`.
If it is not installed, follow the instructions at [python.org](https://www.python.org/) or use your package manager.

You can also setup python and stanza after the initial installation of Kalba.

## Deb (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.)

Download the .deb from the [releases page](https://github.com/BrewingWeasel/Kalba/releases), and install it (ex: sudo dpkg -i (KALBA FILE NAME))

## Rpm (Fedora, OpenSuse, etc.)

Download the .rpm from the [releases page](https://github.com/BrewingWeasel/Kalba/releases), and follow the .rpm installation instructions for your distro (see [the guide for Fedora](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/latest/system-administrators-guide/RPM/))
