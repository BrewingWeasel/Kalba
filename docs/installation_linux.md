# Installation (Linux)

A flatpak of Kalba will eventually be provided, and that will be the recommended way of installing Kalba.
In the mean time, you can use one of the alternate installation methods for Linux.

## Deb (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.)

Download the .deb from the [releases page](https://github.com/BrewingWeasel/Kalba/releases), and install it (ex: sudo dpkg -i (KALBA FILE NAME))

## Rpm (Fedora, OpenSuse, etc.)

Download the .rpm from the [releases page](https://github.com/BrewingWeasel/Kalba/releases), and follow the .rpm installation instructions for your distro (see [the guide for Fedora](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/latest/system-administrators-guide/RPM/))
